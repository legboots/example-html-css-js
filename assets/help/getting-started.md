# Getting Started

## Fork the Repo
### About
Forking a [repository](./glossary.md#repository--repo) gives you a full copy of the codebase, including all history. When you have your own [fork](./glossary.md#fork) of an existing project, you are able to contribute to it without impacting the original project. In your unoffical version, you are the owner!

The intent behind forking is to make your changes and eventually [merge](./glossary.md#merge) them back into the original project via a [pull request](./glossary.md#pull-request), becoming a contributor.

Alternatively [Some forks become more popular than the original project!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_forks)
